                    <p>Hmovie is a digital catalog of over 400+ Hmong movies- aiming to preserve the history of Hmong movies, film-making, and storytelling.</p>
                    <p>In a digital era where technology eases the consumption of media, Hmong movies donâ€™t have that sort of luxury. Their stories are often trapped in VHS tapes or completely forgotten by Hmong generations. </p>
                    <p>Hmovie challenges the extinction of Hmong cinematography by bringing Hmong movies to the forefront using modern-day technology.</p>

            <h1>About the Site</h1>
            <p>Hmovie was officially launched in May 2025. The site was developed under a fellowship program hosted by the Ramsey County Historical Society and Center for Hmong Studies. This project was pursued by fellow, Linda Lor- an upcoming software developer who aspires to bridge technological gaps in her local community.</p>
            <p>The site is hosted with GitHub pages and utilizes the web framework Jekyll to create a dynamic, yet static, site. </p>
