                    <p>Hmovie is a digital catalog of over 400+ Hmong movies- aiming to preserve the history of Hmong movies, film-making, and storytelling.</p>
                    <p>In a digital era where technology eases the consumption of media, Hmong movies donâ€™t have that sort of luxury. Their stories are often trapped in VHS tapes or completely forgotten by Hmong generations. </p>
                    <p class="text_quote">Hmovie challenges the extinction of Hmong cinematography by bringing Hmong movies to the forefront using modern-day technology.</p>

            <h1>About the Site</h1>
            <p>Hmovie was officially launched in May 2025. The site was developed under a fellowship program hosted by the Ramsey County Historical Society and Center for Hmong Studies. This project was pursued by fellow, Linda Lor- an upcoming software developer who aspires to bridge technological gaps in her local community.</p>
            <p>The site is hosted with GitHub pages and utilizes the web framework Jekyll to create a dynamic, yet static, site. </p>

                    <p>Linda Lor (she/her/hers) is a second generation Hmong American from Saint Paul, Minnesota. As a child, watching Hmong movies were one of her favorite pass-time activities and the stories from the movies have sticked since. To preserve the stories and legacy of Hmong movies, Linda launched the site, Hmovie- blending her two biggest passions: Hmong films and software development. Outside of work, she enjoys gaming, drawing comics, and ice skating during the cold Minnesota winters.</p>
