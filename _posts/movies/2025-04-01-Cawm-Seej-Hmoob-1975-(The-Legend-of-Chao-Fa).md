synopsis: "Vaj Tuam Thawj played by Tshaj Hawj was one of such legendary figure. He was born in Xaiyaburi Province of the Nothern Laos. His birth given name was Vang Ze but because of his bravery and fearlessness by rescuing many of his villagers from Communist Pathet Laos Government during the end of the Secret War. His villagers often referred to him as Vaj Tuam Thawj (The Rebirth of The King). With such high hope from his people, Vaj Tuam Thawj continued to fought heroically to protect his people and their territory with hope to retain freedom and independence from the Communist Pathet Laos Government. However, all hell broke loose when Vaj Tuam Thawj's father was taken by the Communist Pathet Laos Goverment because of his former tie with the CIA Special Guerrilla Unit (the 'SGU'), a Secret Army bankroll by the US Central Intelligence Agency (the 'CIA') during the Vietnam War to fight on their proxy war inside Laos. Vaj Tuam Thawj was on his last mission to search for his father's whereabout and later met Paj Nyiag played by Xaim Yaj, a daughter of a Communist Pathet Laos Colonel and a spy sent by the Communist Pathet Laos Government. It's a critical time for both Vaj Tuam Hawj and Paj Nyiag to honor their duty because the fire on their eyes just started burning and inside their heart said otherwise about their future. Now, its Vaj Tuam."
