synopsis: "A story of how love conquers betrayal and only faith will determine one's destiny. Nao Vang (Chapoleon Vang) and Kashua (See Lee) is an ordinary couple about to discover that life isn't always that simple. For Kashia, life is about raising a family and living a happy life, but for her husband Nao Vang, life is about reaching goals and self-satisfaction. After a year of marriage, their relationship quickly takes a downturn when jealousy and suspicion erupted. Nao Vang then hires Cheng (Gernny Lor) to spy on Kashia but only to further complicate things. Kashia falls in love with Cheng. Nao Vang finds out about their relationship and plots to kill them. Will killing Kashia justify his anger? What will Nao Vang do next? Will Cheng be able to save Nao Vang and Kashia's marriage? "
