# Movie Attributes
synopsis: "Thousands of years ago, the folk tale of Yeeb Yaj Yum & Tswv Yeeb Thaij made a lasting impression on the Hmong culture. This story symbolized true love that will never dies. Since we did not have a written language, the tale was narrated orally from generation to generation. Due to the war, we, the Hmong people today, are now living in different corners of the world. For this reason Hmoob Toj Siab Productions decide to preserve this folk tale by enscribing it into written literature by adopting Mor-Lam-Lueng lyric into it. We spent over a year and a half to plan and recruit talented artists to bring life to this story. It is not a simple movie to watch but it is a piece of culture to keep. It is a great challenge and we hope you enjoy this cornerstone of Hmong culture. "
