After being diagnosed with a terminal illness, Leng (Wa Yang), a Hmong-American man, returns to Laos to pay triubute to his late father, whom he never knew. Upon arriving in a small Hmong village, however, Leng's health rapidly deteriorates. Under the care of Joua Pao (Khais Vaj), Leng begins the gradual process of healing. Leng is also befriended by Gao Hlee (Dib Thoj), a young woman who helps him gain new insights to his journey. Meanwhile, Leng must try to make sense of the mysterious encounters with a dark figure."
