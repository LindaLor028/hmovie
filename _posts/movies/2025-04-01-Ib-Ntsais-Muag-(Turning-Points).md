synopsis: "KG is the only son of his parents, who give him unconditional love. He knows that his upbringing has put his parents beyond their comfort zones and now it is time for him to be a responsible son. As he attempts to fulfill his responsibilities as a son, KG engages himself in a hidden mission that requires him to neglect these very responsibilities. He becomes a member of a deadly gang with vicious activities, and careless about his parents. Although his parents still love him unconditionally, their loves continues to be in vain. Finally, once he accomplishes his mission, KG's father dies from saving his life from a terminal disease and his mother is on the verge of death. Now KG wishes to go back in time so he could explain his hidden mission to his parents, change his mothers fate, and, as he wishes, become a responsible son. "
