<p>synopsis: “‘The Boar’s Tusk’ is a legendary story that took place in the Black Mountain, located on the borders of China, Vietnam, and Laos. There was a boar that was very immune, and nobody could kill it. A rich Chinese man offered Ther Pa Chong (the head of the Black Mountain village) a jar of silver bars, a bowl of opium, and two logs of cloth for the boar and its tusks. There was a poor family named Pao Nga who lived in the southern part of that village. He had two sons—one named Tou Kao, 12 years old, and the other named Tou Pheng, one month old. The villagers always disliked Pao Nga’s family. After Pa Chong learned that Pao Nga had the boar tusks, he commanded a group of men to force Pao Nga to hand them over. Pao Nga gave the tusks to his two sons and told them to run away before the men came. Please continue to see what kind of revenge and what kind of fighting would happen after the death of these two orphans’ parents.”
