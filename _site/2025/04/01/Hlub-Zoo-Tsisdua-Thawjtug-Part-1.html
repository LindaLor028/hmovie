<p>synopsis: “A film based on a true love Hmong motion pictures. It’s the most romantic and sad story. Because the conflicts between the teens and the old Hmong generations, the culture can not play its role within a Hmong family, which has caused both generations to become further apart. Sometimes there is an answer to a few questions; somehow there is a way to find out the destination of a question leading to an answer”
