# Welcome to the dev-side of Hmovie!

Hmovie was officially launched in 2025 via the Hmong Studies Fellowship hosted by the Ramsey County Historical Society and Center for Hmong Studies and is currently maintained by the Hmovie Team- which consists of

Hmovie is a community-managed site that relies on the expertise and contributions of individuals. For that reason, Hmovie is always looking for contributors to ensure the siteâ€™s accuracy in information and experience in implementation. If you're interested in contributing, join here!


# The Hmovie Dev Stack
Hmovie is developed using HTML, CSS, and the web-framework Jekyll- which allows the site to be entirely static (aka doesn't rely on servers). As a result, the maintenance of Hmovie regards the following: updating UI occassionally, debugging, and  adding movies/actors to the database. 

# How Does It Work?
In addition to the site's user experience, the development experience for Hmovie is also designed to be simple and easy. It works like this: movies are documented in a spreadsheet and when ready, they can be plugged into the Hmovie website as a markdown (md) file. This file is then read by the code and generates a completely new page for a movie. 

# Attributions + Acknowledgements
First and foremost, Hmovie would not be possible without without a grant funded by an appropriation to the Minnesota Historical Society from the Minnesota Arts and Cultural Heritage Fund. This grant funded the fellowship program, hosted by the Center for Hmong Studies and Ramsey County Historical Society, which brought this project to life.
