# Welcome to the dev-side of Hmovie!

Hmovie is a digital catalog of over 300 Hmong movies- aiming to preserve the history of Hmong movies, film-making, and storytelling. Hmovie was officially launched in 2025 via the Hmong Studies Fellowship hosted by the Ramsey County Historical Society and Center for Hmong Studies and is currently maintained by the Hmovie Team- which consists of:

Hmovie is a community-managed site that relies on the expertise and contributions of individuals. For that reason, Hmovie is always looking for contributors to ensure the site’s accuracy in information and experience in implementation.

# The Hmovie Dev Stack
Hmovie is developed using HTML, CSS, and the web-framework Jekyll- which allows the site to be entirely static (aka doesn't rely on servers). As a result, the maintenance of Hmovie regards the following: updating UI occassionally, debugging, and  adding movies/actors to the database. 

# How Does It Work?
In addition to the site's user experience, the development experience for Hmovie is also designed to be simple and easy. It works like this: movies are documented in a spreadsheet and when ready, they can be plugged into the Hmovie website as a markdown (md) file. This file is then read by the code and generates a completely new page for a movie. 

# Acknowledgements
First and foremost, Hmovie would not be possible without without a grant funded by an appropriation to the Minnesota Historical Society from the [Minnesota Arts and Cultural Heritage Fund](https://www.legacy.mn.gov/arts-cultural-heritage-fund). This grant funded the fellowship program, hosted by the [Center for Hmong Studies](https://www.csp.edu/center-for-hmong-studies/) and [Ramsey County Historical Society](https://rchs.com/), which brought this project to life.

Secondly, I would like to extend an additional thank you to the Ramsey County Historical Society and Center for Hmong Studies. The Ramsey County Historical Society provided rich mentorship and guidance to me while working on Hmovie which only enhanced my Hmovie’s quality. The Center for Hmong Studies provided over 300 Hmong movies to be cataloged in Hmovie and also provided deep cultural knowledge that can only be learned through hands-on experience. 

Next, I would like to extend a thank you to Nadja Baer from Fredrickson who provided guidance on developing a legal statement to ensure the site’s preservation of Hmong films whilst still maintaining the integrity of sharing films online. 

Lastly, a huge thank you to all those who participated in user interviews and gave active feedback on the project. Dreaming big with me and realizing the importance of a Hmong movie database always motivated me to keep working on Hmovie when things were tough.
